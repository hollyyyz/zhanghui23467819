      <p>In Hong Kong, a multicultural city, many mainlanders have taken root in this bustling city. 
        They are gradually adapting to the new environment, learning the local language and integrating into local life. Through the experiences of three different individuals, we will deeply explore the life stories of mainlanders in Hong Kong, 
        the challenges they face in different cultural backgrounds, and explore the process of cross-cultural integration.</p>

      <h5>Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger Reveals the Secrets of Happiness in 75 Years of Research 
    </h5></div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>BOSTON - In a profound exploration of happiness, psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, captivated the audience at TED x BeaconStreet with the elusive question, What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life?</p>
      <p>Waldinger manages one of the longest-running tracking studies of adult life and well-being, which began in 1938 and has tracked people from diverse life backgrounds, Harvard students, and slum kids for more than 75 years, showing that the quality of our attention is the cornerstone of a good life.Waldinger says, "The clearest message we get from this 75-year study is that good relationships make us more, well, healthy. It's that simple and happy."</p>
      <p>Throughout his engaging presentation, Waldinger outlined three conclusions about happiness and longevity, drawn from tens of thousands of pages of richly documented data, including the medical records of the original participants, personal interviews and questionnaires conducted every two years with participants ranging from Harvard Starbucks to residents of downtown Boston, and more recently, their descendants.</p>
      <p>The first conclusion: social relationships are good for us, and loneliness is bad for our health.
        Isolated people tend to be more unhappy than those who aren't lonely, and people become physically unhealthy in middle age, with brain function declining more rapidly. Nor do they live longer, even though just one in five Americans at least claims to be lonely.
        </p>
        <p>The second conclusion: it doesn't matter how many friends you have around you or whether you have a partner, it's the quality of those relationships that really makes a difference. It's the quality of intimate relationships that matters. Living in conflict is bad for our health.</p>
      <p>The third conclusion: Happy relationships protect not only our bodies, but also our brains.
        Happy and harmonious marriages are good for health, and those who enjoy their retirement the most are those who actively replace their workmates with playmates.</p>      
      <p>Waldinger has shown through 75 years of research time and time again that those who live the happiest lives tend to be those who actively engage with others. True fulfilment comes from our connections with others. Encouraging everyone to be more involved with people rather than will make themselves happy by being in the wealth of fame, 
        Waldinger's message resonated with the audience, inspiring loud applause and stimulating discussion about true happiness.</p>
        <p>In a society where many people chase fame and wealth to succeed, Waldinger and his team's 75 years of research provide valuable insights that remind and guide many people to become happier by engaging with people and maintaining good relationships.</p>
